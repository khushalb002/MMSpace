# Grievance Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive Grievance system for the MMSpace mentee-mentor platform. This feature allows mentees to submit grievances and mentors to review and manage them, similar to the existing leave request system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation

#### Database Model (`/server/models/Grievance.js`)
- Created a comprehensive Grievance schema with fields:
  - `menteeId` and `mentorId` (references)
  - `name`, `email`, `rollNo` (user information)
  - `subject` (grievance title)
  - `grievanceType` (categorized dropdown options)
  - `description` (detailed description)
  - `dateOfIncident` (when the incident occurred)
  - `status` (pending, in-review, resolved, rejected)
  - `mentorComments`, `adminComments`, `resolution`
  - Timestamps for tracking creation, review, and resolution

#### API Routes (`/server/routes/grievanceRoutes.js`)
- **POST `/api/grievances`** - Submit new grievance (mentee only)
- **GET `/api/grievances/mentee`** - Get mentee's grievances
- **GET `/api/grievances/mentor`** - Get mentor's mentees' grievances
- **GET `/api/grievances/admin`** - Get all grievances (admin only)
- **PUT `/api/grievances/:id/review`** - Review grievance (mentor/admin)
- **PUT `/api/grievances/:id/resolve`** - Resolve grievance (mentor/admin)
- **PUT `/api/grievances/:id/reject`** - Reject grievance (mentor/admin)

#### Dashboard Integration
- Updated mentee dashboard routes to include grievance statistics
- Updated mentor dashboard routes to include grievance counts
- Added real-time notifications via Socket.IO

### 2. Frontend Implementation

#### Grievance Page (`/client/src/pages/GrievancePage.jsx`)
- **Complete grievance management interface** with:
  - Submit new grievance form with all required fields
  - Filter grievances by status (all, pending, in-review, resolved, rejected)
  - View detailed grievance information in modal
  - Mentor actions (review, resolve, reject)
  - Status and priority indicators
  - Responsive design with beautiful UI

#### Form Fields (As Requested)
- **Name** - Text (auto-filled if logged in)
- **Email / Roll No / ID** - Text
- **Subject / Title** - Text
- **Grievance Type** - Dropdown with categories:
  - Misconduct / Complaint
  - User Experience
  - Billing / Payment
  - Communication & Support
  - Administrative Issues
  - Technical Issues
  - Other
- **Date of Incident** - Date picker
- **Description** - Textarea for detailed description

#### Dashboard Integration
- Added Grievance cards to both mentee and mentor dashboards
- Shows total grievances count and navigation to grievance page
- Real-time updates of grievance statistics

#### Navigation
- Added "Grievances" link to the sidebar navigation
- Available for both mentors and mentees
- Uses FileText icon from Lucide React
