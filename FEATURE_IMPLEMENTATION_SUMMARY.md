# Feature Implementation Summary

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Group Messaging Enhancement
**Issue**: When mentor creates a group and sends messages, they should show up for all mentees in the group.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Server-side**: Updated `server/routes/messageRoutes.js` to emit group messages to all group members
- **Socket handling**: Enhanced `server/socket/socketHandlers.js` to auto-join mentees to their groups
- **Real-time updates**: Messages now broadcast to both group room and individual mentee rooms for notifications

**Files Modified**:
- `server/routes/messageRoutes.js` - Enhanced group message broadcasting
- `server/socket/socketHandlers.js` - Auto-join mentees to groups on connection

### 2. Leave Request Filtering Fix
**Issue**: In mentee dashboard, leave requests not showing correctly in filtered tabs (approved, pending, etc.)

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Frontend filtering**: Added client-side filtering in `client/src/pages/LeavesPage.jsx`
- **Backend support**: Enhanced server-side filtering with better error handling
- **UI updates**: Fixed display to use `filteredLeaves` instead of raw `leaves` array

**Files Modified**:
- `client/src/pages/LeavesPage.jsx` - Added proper filtering logic
- `server/routes/leaveRoutes.js` - Enhanced with retry logic and better error handling

### 3. Enhanced Chat with Individual Mentee Selection
**Issue**: Chat button should prompt mentor to select which mentee to chat with, with close chat option.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Mentee Selection Modal**: Created `client/src/components/MenteeSelectionModal.jsx`
- **Search functionality**: Added search by name, student ID, and class-section
- **Dynamic conversation creation**: Mentors can now start individual chats with any mentee
- **Close chat functionality**: Added dropdown menu with close chat option
- **UI enhancements**: Modern modal design with smooth animations

### 4. Announcement Feed with Comments
**Issue**: Create announcement feed visible to all mentees under a mentor, with comment functionality.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Announcement Model**: Added comments array to `server/models/Announcement.js`
- **Comment API**: Added comment endpoints in `server/routes/announcementRoutes.js`
  - `POST /api/announcements/:id/comments` - Add comment
  - `GET /api/announcements/:id/comments` - Get comments
- **Rich Announcement Feed**: Created `client/src/components/AnnouncementFeed.jsx`
- **Real-time updates**: Socket.io integration for live comments and announcements
- **Role-based access**: Mentees can view and comment, mentors can create and manage
